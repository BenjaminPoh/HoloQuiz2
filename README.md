## FAQ
Q1. HoloQuiz but no Hololive Questions in QuestionBank.yml? Blasphemy!

A1. Hello I use this for HoloCraft. You'd think I would upload it and give everyone the answers?
I will upload it if HoloCraft closes. Till then, I can also sell you my question bank for $44.50 though hehe

Q2. When will [Insert any request/feature] be implemented?

A2. idk man I do this for fun

Q3. Why is it HoloQuiz2? Where is HoloQuiz1?

A3. Don't ask

Q4. Why is there a bta command in Rewards.yml?

A4. Because HoloCraft uses a plugin that uses that command. So it's there on default for my convenience.

Q5. What placeholders can I use?

A5. Most placeholders are applicable only for the Contests feature, with 1 exception: `[player]` can be used for the reward 
in item rewards and commands for answering questions too.

| Placeholder | Description               | Example Output  |
|-------------|---------------------------|-----------------|
| `[player]`  | The player's name         | ShirakamiFubuki |
| `[count]`   | Number of answers given   | 446             |
| `[best]`    | Best time recorded (s)    | 1.68            |
| `[avg]`     | Average answer time (s)   | 7.27            |
| `[month]`   | Current contest month     | September       |
| `[year]`    | Current contest year      | 2025            |
| `[start]`   | Contest start date        | 2025-05-01      |
| `[end]`     | Contest end date          | 2025-05-31      |
| `[pos]`     | Player's numeric rank     | 1               |
| `[pos++]`   | Player's rank (formatted) | 1st             |

Note: Someone asked me "Why does `[start]` and `[end]` return the same result for Daily contests?" I don't feel like answering.


## Special Credits

I would like to thank ChatGPT for borderline carrying this project. ChatGPT has:
- Shown me the basics of making my own Java Plugin in Minecraft and taught me how to achieve the features I want to implement.
- Sparing me from reading age-old documentation by summarising them succinctly.
- Teaching me how to use database systems and write SQL Queries.
- Rekindled my love for database systems after my University killed it.
- Helping me with various debugging, including proper fetching from resources and timezone issues used in Contests.
